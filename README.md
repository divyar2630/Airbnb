Airbnb Relational Database Management System

The project focus was to understand how a company as an online
marketplace offering homestays utilizes a digital platform with their Database and
Relational Database Management System model to manage its property listings and
stakeholders (Guest and Host only in this case). Through this data repository, we explore and analyse
how AirBnB enables both Hosts and Guests to make informed, data-backed decisions for
interaction choices in both online and offline world and also track their organizationâ€™s
periodic and overall performance. Our focus is to make scalable data by designing RDBMS
for a city (San Francisco, California, USA) that can be expanded further in a similar fashion
into states and countries to cover their area of presence.
