Airbnb Relational Database Management System

The project focus was to understand how a company as an online
marketplace offering homestays utilizes a digital platform with their Database and
Relational Database Management System model to manage its property listings and
stakeholders (Guest and Host only in this case). Through this data repository, we explore and analyse
how AirBnB enables both Hosts and Guests to make informed, data-backed decisions for
interaction choices in both online and offline world and also track their organization’s
periodic and overall performance. Our focus is to make scalable data by designing RDBMS
for a city (San Francisco, California, USA) that can be expanded further in a similar fashion
into states and countries to cover their area of presence.

## Data Collection: 
 
 ​The data has been sourced from InsideAirBnB website which is
further sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site. The project
focuses on a part of the data available- San Francisco, California. The link to the source can
be referred to from ​http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

## Intent:

● On the front-end, for Airbnb, the user interface enables the search, collaboration
and discovery of metadata related to accomodation rentals. ​We aim to illustrate
how integral it is to incorporate a schema design that can make core processes
related to these tasks, like populating new data records or maintaining databases
more systematic even for non-experts to perform analytics.

● Furthermore, we seek to explore for a real-world fast-growing organization as
AirBnB, what variety of metadata information is captured and how database model
design captures this information about different data assets wherein their
connectivity reflects the relationships of consumption, production, association, etc.

● By making a good schema and design of the database we can search, retrieve and
analyze data to gather insights which would be extremely helpful in answering
relevant questions like what is the occupancy rate of a listing? Or what is the income
per month of each listing? Or evaluate discrete time slots available for a property or
find a superhost based on some eligibility criteria
